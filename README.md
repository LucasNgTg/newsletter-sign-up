## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It is easier to use custom bullet points in list items by assigning a background image, rather than using `list-style-type`.

I do not understand why `format(font/ttf)` didn't work in the `src` of `@font-face`.

Flexbox is better when the container has to change its size depending on the content, while Grid is better when the content has to fit a predefined layout.

### Continued development

Workflow with external libraries.
